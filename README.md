üìò Description:
This project involves the end-to-end development of a mobile robotic arm capable of performing basic pick-and-place tasks. The system combines mechanical design, electronic control, and embedded programming to enable autonomous or manually controlled motion of the arm mounted on a mobile platform.
The robotic arm is designed with multiple degrees of freedom (DOF), and is fabricated using lightweight, cost-effective materials. Control is achieved through a microcontroller (such as Arduino or ESP32), and can be operated using wireless commands, joystick input, or programmed sequences.

üîß Features:
4/5 DOF robotic arm for basic manipulation
Mounted on a mobile robot base for extended range
Manual and remote control modes (Bluetooth/WiFi)
DC/servo motor actuation
Potential integration with sensors (e.g., ultrasonic, IR) for obstacle avoidance

‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used:
CAD Design: SolidWorks 
Microcontroller: Arduino / ESP32
Control Code:  Arduino IDE
Motors: Servo motors, DC motors with driver module (L298N)
Chassis: Acrylic or aluminum base with caster wheels

üéØ Applications:
Object sorting and placing,
Warehouse automation prototype,
Educational and research purposes.
